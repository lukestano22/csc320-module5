# Weekly Temperature Tracker

This Java program allows users to input daily temperatures for a week, stores the values, and displays the full week's data along with the average temperature when prompted.

## 📋 Features

- Accepts day and temperature input for 7 days.
- Stores data using `ArrayList` for flexible management.
- Displays each day's temperature.
- Calculates and displays the average weekly temperature.
- Accepts user input using Java's `Scanner`.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user is prompted 7 times to enter:
   - The **day of the week**.
   - The **temperature in Fahrenheit** for that day.
2. After data collection, the user types `"week"` to:
   - Display all recorded days and temperatures.
   - Show the **average temperature** for the week.
